                        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">*  Marium was a compassionate, hardworking, and sincere person. Besides being a great pilot, she was also a good football player. She was very impressed with the Pakistan Army’s discipline and uniform, so she decided to join the Pakistan Air Force.
                        </p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">* she was born on May 18, 1992, in Karachi. Till her death, she lived in the same city.
                            </p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">* She completed her schooling from Mehran Model School and College in Pano Akil. She passed the Intermediate Examination from Army Public School and College, Malir Cantt, Karachi.
                            </p> <p style="margin-left: 20px;">*  Due to the military environment at home, she had the desire to join the army and perform the high duty of defending the homeland since her childhood. She joined the Pakistan Air Force on May 6, 2011, and graduated from the Air Force on September 24, 2014.
                            </p> <p style="margin-left: 20px;">* On the morning of November 24, 2015, she left for her usual practice with her instructor, Saqib Abbasi. While they were flying in the skies of Gujarat district, suddenly, the engine caught fire, and it started burning. In this critical situation, the pilot must jump out of the plane immediately.
                            </p> <p style="margin-left: 20px;">*  Only then can his life be saved. But the conscience of Maryam Shaheed and Saqib Abbasi did not allow them to jump quickly. The plane was flying over the population, and fields were far away. The two brave pilots decided to postpone the jump for a few moments so that the plane could reach the fields instead of the population.
                            </p> <p style="margin-left: 20px;">*  Martyr Maryam was posthumously awarded the ‘Medal of Courage’ for her tremendous courage and sense of responsibility. She also has the honor of being the first fighter pilot of the Pakistan Air Force to be martyred on duty.
